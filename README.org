* Some basic information about vscode.
VScode has 3 groups in which settings are managed.
Each of these groups have the same settings but effect different scopes in which
these settings are applied.

#+CAPTION:If you enter your settings(Ctrl + ,), you will see these three options; User, Workspace, and a folder pointing to the one you have opened.
[[./settings.png]]

All affected in the User settings will effect ALL projects and files you edit in VScode.

All settings affected in the Workspace settings will effect ALL files in your workspace(s)

All settings affected in the 3rd option(Name of your current workspace) will effect ALL files in that specific workspace.
Changing settings in the 3rd option will create a '.vscode' folder inside that specific workspace folder.
These settings in this .vscode folder will tell VSCode not to use the global settings nor the workspace settings, and instead
use the settings inside this folder.

* To use this repo for the current project we are working on...
Copy this .vscode inside the project folder we are working on.

After moving this folder into your current workspace, after editing or changing files, a little box
on the bottom right of VScode will ask you to install plugins that are recommended. These plugins are
essential for the .vscode configuration to run properly.

In this .vscode folder these are the plugins that are recommended in the extensions.json.

| ms-python.python                   | Used for python development, includes intellisense, linting, etc                                               |
| batisteo.vscode-django             | Used for django development                                                                                    |
| Christian-kohlet.path-intellisense | Used to for path intellisense(suggesting correct file paths)                                                   |
| esbenp.prettier-vscode             | Used by our project to have uniform formatting; This will be used by the settings.json file to autoformat code |
|------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Out of these, the prettier plugin is most important because it is used by the settings.json file to
auto-format html,django-html,css,json, and markdown files upon saving.

In the settings.json file, VSCode will automatically use a default program called autopep8 to format
our python files to PEP8 format(https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/). If not installed it will prompt
you to install it.
